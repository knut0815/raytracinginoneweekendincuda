Ray Tracing in One Weekend in CUDA -Optimized-==============================================This code is an optimization exercise of the excelent _Ray Tracing in One Weekend in CUDA_.I've made several changes to make the code run faster on my hardware:- I switched from the default cuRand random generator to curandStatePhilox4\_32\_10 as it was taking too long to initialize- using _struct_ instead of _class_ for the scene objects- simplified the kernel logic in various places to reduce the register count- initialize the scene on the host and copy it to constant memory- using my own random number generatorThe code includes a Visual Studio solution, and was developped with CUDA 9.2.If you run the renderer from the command line you can optionally pass a number to indicate how many sample it should render per pixel. Default is 10. The argument parsing logic is rudimentary and the program may crash if you don't pass a positive value.On my hardware (GTX 1050), rendering an image of 1200x800 using 10 samples takes ~ .6s
